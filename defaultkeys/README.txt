You MUST regenerate new keys when using the honeypot, to avoid detection and potential intrusion!!

Create a new directory named "keys" at the root of this repo.

Them, to regenerate the SSH keys, type :

ssh-keygen -f ssh_host_rsa_key

To generate the RSA keys and x509 certs, run the "gencerts.sh" script from within your "keys" directory.
