# Honeypot üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Welcome to our Honeypot repository! This project is designed as a medium to high interaction honeypot: external requests won't actually interact with a real information system but will convincingly pretend to do so.

## How Does It Work? ü§î

Basically, using RegExes, if a requests looks like a valid HTTP protocol GET request, it will match agains a rule and be answered with HTTP content.

If another request looks like a SQL injection tentative on a WordPress, it might be anwered accordingly to simulate a WordPress environment.

We aim to simulate interaction, but there is actually no potentially vulnerable database or filesystem for attackers to exploit.

- Telnet 
- POP 
- SMTP 
- HTTP 
- ADB 
- SSH
